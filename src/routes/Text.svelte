Hey there! I'm BlauFx, 20 y/o.<br>
I try to use my time as efficiently/productively as possible, which sadly doesn't work out quite as often as I would like it to.<br>
Nevertheless, I strive improve myself and I would like to receive criticism about things that I could improve on.<br>
<br>
I'm a full-time Linux enthusiast.<br>
In my free time I play video games, develop stuff, watch anime, try to make some AMVs, or tinker around with Linux.<br>
I am interested in a variety of areas, starting from web development, cybersecurity, games, reverse engineering over to kernel development.<br>
