Hey there! I'm BlauFx, 20 y/o.<br>
<br>
I strive improve myself and I would like to receive criticism about things that I could improve on.<br>
I'm a full-time Linux enthusiast. I study computer science and mathematics at University Bielefeld, Germany.<br>
<br>
In my free time I play video games, like to develop, watch anime, try to make some AMVs, or tinker around with Linux.<br>
I am interested in a variety of areas, starting from games, cybersecurity, reverse engineering over to kernel development.<br>
<br>

Just for fun I would like to mention an interesting philosophy is Stoicism and the Kaizen principles.
